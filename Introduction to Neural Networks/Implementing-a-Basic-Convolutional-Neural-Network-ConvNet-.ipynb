    "\n",
    "### **Why This Accuracy is Reasonable**\n",
    "1. **Dataset Characteristics**:  \n",
    "   The MNIST dataset is relatively simple, with well-structured and clean grayscale images of digits. Many models achieve over 99% accuracy on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Design**:  \n",
    "   Your network includes:\n",
    "   - Two convolutional layers for feature extraction.\n",
    "   - Pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions.\n",
    "   - Fully connected layers for final classification.  \n",
    "   This architecture is powerful enough to classify MNIST images with high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adam Optimizer**:  \n",
    "   The Adam optimizer adapts learning rates during training, which helps achieve convergence faster and more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Balanced Data**:  \n",
    "   The dataset is balanced across all 10 classes (digits 0–9), making it less prone to bias during training.\n",

    "- **Experiment with Hyperparameters**: Test different optimizers, learning rates, or architectures to explore their impact on performance.\n",
    "- **Use a Complex Dataset**: Test your model on more challenging datasets like CIFAR-10 or Fashion-MNIST for broader insights.\n",
