    "This lab focuses on problem-solving using mathematical foundations and Python programming. Understanding optimization, geometric relationships, and numerical computation provides a strong base for neural network concepts. This exercise involves finding the points on a circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \\) that are closest to and furthest from a given point \\( (a, b) \\). By completing this lab, you‚Äôll bridge foundational math with Python programming.\n",
