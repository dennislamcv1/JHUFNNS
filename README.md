## Foundations of Neural Networks Specialization

This Specialization is intended for post-graduate students seeking to develop advanced skills in neural networks and deep learning. Through three courses, you will cover the mathematical theory behind neural networks, including feed-forward, convolutional, and recurrent architectures, as well as deep learning optimization, regularization techniques, unsupervised learning, and generative adversarial networks. You will also explore the ethical issues associated with neural network applications. By the end of the specialization, you will gain hands-on experience in formulating and implementing algorithms using Python, allowing you to apply theoretical concepts to real-world data. This specialization prepares you to design, analyze, and deploy neural networks for practical applications in fields such as AI, machine learning, and data science, and equips you with the tools to address ethical considerations in AI systems. As you progress, you'll be able to independently implement and evaluate a variety of neural network models, setting a strong foundation for a career in AI research or development.
